# PartitionProblem

College project about modified Partition Problem. I used few diferent strategies to solve it:
- Heuristics
- Metaheuristics
- Greedy Algorithm

To work, program needs:
- K - number of subsets into which the program devides the main set
- N - number of elements in the set
- randRange - range of randomly generated numbers
