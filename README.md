# PartitionProblem

College project about modified Partition Problem. I used few diferent strategies to solve it:
- Heuristics
- Metaheuristics
- Greedy Algorithm

To work, program needs:
- K - How much subsets should it try to create
- N - How much elements in the generated random array
- randRange - The upper limit of how big the generated integers can be
